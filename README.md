Mane-teNance was created as part of a Node Capstone for ThinkFul. It contains different technologies for development like NodeJS, Mongo and Mongoose for the backend. Embedded JavaScript templating, MomentJS and Materialize as the front-end framework for responsive User Interface.

I created this app with the idea and inspiration from my part-time job as a hairstylist and freelance bridal artist. I needed a way to keep all my clients together and track their services. I hope to continually add and refine this app further but so far, the idea is really great and so necessary for the freelance hairstylists out there. 

This app provides users with an informative list of services from their hairdresser and allows them to schedule their appointments with available time slots.

From the Login Page, one can utilize the demo account to use the app to see its resources!

Once logged in, users can view the services offered and select them as needed. A cart will calculate the time accrued.

When the user clicks Confirm on the cart, they will be directed to a schedule page to view a list of times available for them to book their appointment.

User will then select a time fitting for their schedule and they will be redirected to a confirmation page when they can see the day and time of their appointment.

Another great feature of Mane'tenance is the Dashboard. A page where users can see their past bookings so they can have access to the history of their account!
